    TRACE: The finest level of logging, used to trace the execution of the program in great detail. This is useful for debugging, but generally generates a lot of output.

    DEBUG: Provides detailed information, typically useful only for developers during the debugging process. Itâ€™s more concise than TRACE but still provides useful information about program flow.

    INFO: General information about the application's operation, typically used to provide information on the system's state or milestones (e.g., when an application starts or finishes a task).

    WARN: Warnings about potential issues that aren't necessarily errors, but might need attention in the future. These typically indicate a problem that could become serious if left unaddressed.

    ERROR: Logs that indicate serious issues, typically when something has gone wrong in the application, and immediate attention is required.

    FATAL: The highest level of logging. Indicates severe errors that may cause the application to terminate. This level is typically used for critical failures.
